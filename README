NChess

NChess is a python implementation of chess for an arbitrary number of players.
There is no GUI, yet.
To play, just type

python threechess.py

and you can play at the command prompt.
To get a graphical representation of the board after each move, use

python gui.py

which will save the board to a file called board{move_number}.png after each
move.
If don't want to play yourself, you can watch the computer do so, using

python aiplayer.py

Right now, this will just instantiate a number of players with random moves.
